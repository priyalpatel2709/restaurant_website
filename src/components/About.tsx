                  Bella Vista was founded in 1952 by Nonna Maria Rossi, who brought her family's 
                  treasured recipes from the hills of Tuscany to create a warm, welcoming space 
                  where food brings people together.
                </p>
                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Today, her grandson Chef Antonio continues the tradition, sourcing the finest 
                  ingredients from Italy and local farms to create dishes that honor our heritage 
                  while embracing modern culinary techniques.

                <p className="leading-relaxed">
                  Our restaurant is more than just a place to dine - it's a celebration of 
                  Italian culture, family values, and the joy of sharing exceptional food 
                  with the people you love.
